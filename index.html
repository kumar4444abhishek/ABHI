</ul>
  <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and engaged in the current moment, without judgment.
     <br>
  
    It involves paying attention to our thoughts, feelings, and surroundings with a sense of curiosity and acceptance. This ancient practice, rooted in meditation and contemplative traditions, has gained significant popularity in recent years as a way to enhance mental well-being.
